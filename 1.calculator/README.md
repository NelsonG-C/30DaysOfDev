# 1. Calculator

This is the first mini project of my 30 Days of JavaScript.
I'm using this project as a baseline project which I will rebuild.

I can already tell that my use of React here is less than optimal in places.
A big part of this challenge is to refresh myself on some topics and ideas that I have used less over the last couple of months.

At the end of the challenge, I will rebuild this same project, and hopefully notice a great difference in my speed, project layout and structure, and code quality.
